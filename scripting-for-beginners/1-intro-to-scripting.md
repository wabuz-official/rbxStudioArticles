# Intro to Scripting

In this course, we will cover everything you need to know to **start making games**. I expect you to have slight knowledge with **Roblox Studio** (inserting parts, unions, meshes, etc.)

## What is Lua?

**Lua**, also known as **Luau**, is a **high level programming language** that is used as the language for **Roblox** to code games. It was made by **Roberto Ierusalimschy**, **Waldemar Celes** and **Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo**
Lua is very similiar to Python in different aspects, so if you know a bit of **Python**, it may be easier for you to understand and learn **Lua**.

**Lua** is not only used by **Roblox**, it's used for other games like [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/), [Angry Birds](https://www.angrybirds.com/) and [Dark Souls](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570940/DARK_SOULS_REMASTERED/)
In 2003, a survey by GameDev.net showed Lua was the most popular scripting language for programming games.

## Printing stuff

Before I teach you how to print stuff in the console, make sure you have **Output** visible. You can do this by going to **VIEW --> OUTPUT**.

Now that's out of the way, create a new **Script** in **ServerScriptServer**, you can name it anything you'd like or just keep it default.
When you create the script, you should start with preset code:
```lua
print("Hello World!")
```
The quotes in the brackets defy a string, which is the text we want to print out. You can put anything in the quotes from **"Hello, people of Roblox!"** to **"I like hotdogs!"**. Really, it can be _**anything**_!

Now, go to the **HOME** tab and press **Run** by press the arrow pointing down under the **Play** button.

### And that concludes the first article on how to script in **Roblox**!
