# Basic Math

In **Roblox**, we are able to script **math equations** to **calculate** an **answer** to something. These **equations** can be **very basic** or **very complex** depending on the use.

## Performing Addition

We are going to create **2 variables** we want to **add together**. I am going to use **2** and **7**.

Next, we're going to define a **variable** for those **2 numbers** like so:
```lua
local FirstNumber = 2
local SecondNumber = 7
```

Next, to **add them together**, we are going to create a **variable** called **Equation**.
In the **Equation variable**, we are going to use the following code to add the numbers together:

```lua
local Equation = FirstNumber + SecondNumber
```
Yeah.. it's that simple I know...

## Printing out our **Equation answer**

If you remember, I stated in the **previous article** on **variables** that to print out a **variable**, you have to **remove** the **quotations**, which we are going to do like so:

```lua
print(Equation)
```

Now, when you **run the game**, you see our **answer** for the **equation** prints out like so:

You can do the same thing for subraction, division and multiplication. However, you need to use the following symbols:
> Addition [+]

> Subtraction [-]

> Multiplication [*]

> Division [/]

### And that concludes the third article on how to script in Roblox!
#### Next time we will learn about creating and using functions!
