# rbxStudioArticles

I made this repository for the sole purpose of teaching roblox developers at any Lua programming level.
Feel free to use this in your roblox game, credit me if you'd like, I don't really care.

Each article usually takes me 1-2 hours ðŸ¥² so to support my work, please share this with others and star the repository.

This repository is inspired by [EgoMoose's Roblox Studio Articles](https://github.com/EgoMoose/Articles)
