# Intro to oop

## What is oop?

**OOP**, also known as **Object-Oriented Programming**, is procedural programming that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic.

**For more information**, see [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).


## Setting up oop for [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create)

First, we are going to install a plugin for Roblox Studio called [Tag Editor](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/948084095/Tag-Editor)

### What is Tag Editor?

> **Tag Editor** is a plugin for Roblox Studio that allows you to **attach tags to [instances](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance)**, which
> allows you to **manage and organize scripts for instances more efficiently**.

> For more information, check out the **[Devforum Post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/tag-editor-plugin/101465)**.

Once you have installed **Tag Editor**, go over to the **PLUGINS** tab in **Roblox Studio** and click on **Tag Window**.

Next, you should see a window similiar to the following image:

Next, head over to the **HOME** tab and create a new part.

In the **Tag Editor** plugin, you should see **Add new tag...**, click on it and assign a name for the tag, for example, **MyTag**, then press **Enter**.

If you'd like, you can customize the tag by clicking on the **light bulb icon** and customizing it in however way you'd like; However, this will not be
visible to the player.

Then, click on the part you've made and click the checkbox next to the tag like so:

### In the next tutorial, I will show you how to script the tags to actually work.
